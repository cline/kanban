# Changelog

## [0.1.5]

- Added Droid CLI agent support alongside Claude and Codex
- Dogfood launcher for quickly opening Kanban on its own repo with runtime port selection
- Terminal rebuilt around xterm and node-pty for better performance and reliability
- Filter terminal device attribute auto-responses from being sent to agents as input
- Fix workspace metadata causing unnecessary rerenders, with retry recovery
- Fix task worktrees being recreated when the base ref updates if they already exist
- Fix self-ignored directories being symlinked in task worktrees
- Fix bypass permissions toggle resetting unexpectedly
- Fix git refs not clearing when switching detail scope

## [0.1.4]

- Each task gets its own CLI agent working in a git worktree, so they can work in parallel on the same codebase without stepping on each other
- When an agent finishes, review diffs and leave comments before deciding what to merge
- Commit or open a PR directly from the board, and the agent writes the commit message or PR description for you
- Link tasks together to create dependency chains, where one task finishing kicks off the next, letting you complete large projects end to end
- "Automatically commit" and "automatically open PR" toggles give agents more autonomy to complete work on their own
- MCP integration lets agents add and start tasks on the board themselves, decomposing large work into parallelizable linked tasks
- Built-in git visualizer shows your branches and commit history so you can track the work your agents are doing
